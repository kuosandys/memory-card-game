# Memory Card Game: _Healthy Edition_

Not only is this memory game an exercise for your mind, it also contains more than enough fruits and vegetables to get your five-a-day (on a serious note though: eat your veggies). The game is simple enough: click on the image you haven't seen before, and watch your score go up. Click on the wrong card though, and your score resets to zero. Don't worry though - your high score is saved for subsequent rounds so you have a target to beat!
